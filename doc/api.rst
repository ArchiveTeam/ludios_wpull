API
===

Here lists all documented classes and functions. Not all members are documented yet. Some members, such as the backported modules, are not documented here.

If the documentation is not sufficient, please take a look at the source code. Suggestions and improvements are welcomed.

.. Warning:: The API is not thread-safe. It is intended to be run asynchronously with Tornado.

.. Note:: Many functions also are decorated with the :func:`tornado.gen.coroutine` decorator. These functions return a ``Future`` and alternatively accept a ``callback`` parameter. For more information, see: http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/gen.html.
