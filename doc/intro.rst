Wpull is designed to be (almost) a drop-in replacement for Wget with
minimal changes to options. It is designed to run on much larger crawls
without requiring additional demand on resources.


Wpull's behavior is not an exact duplicate of Wget's behavior. As such,
you should not expect exact output and operation out of Wpull. However,
it aims to be a very useful alternative as its source code can be
easily modified to fix, change, or extend its behaviors.
