   Additional intro stuff not in the README should go below.

Wpull's behavior is not an exact duplicate of Wget's behavior. As such,
you should not expect exact output and operation out of Wpull. However,
Wpull aims to be a very useful alternative as its source code can be
easily modified to fix or change some behaviors.
