Scripts for building binary executables.

These scripts are not complete and are experimental. Feel free to fix them up so we have reliable builds for those who want them.


cx_freeze
---------

cx_freeze puts binaries into a directory. It is not actively maintained. Building with this target may be removed in the future.


pyinstaller
-----------

PyInstaller is more actively maintained and also supports producing a single stand-alone binary. Work should be preferred for this target.
