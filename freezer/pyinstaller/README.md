pyinstaller
===========

The `runner.py` script is designed to install dependencies into a virtualenv.

It currently only works in Debian/Ubuntu.


Quick Start
===========

1. Install virtualenv.
2. Run the script. Use something like `python3 runner.py`. It will download pyinstaller and all of Wpull's dependencies.
