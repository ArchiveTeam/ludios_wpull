    The order of the callbacks depend on the protocol.

    For HTTP, the following sequence is typical:

    1. pre_request: Beginning of header.
    2. request_data: Bytes of the header and upload body.
    3. request: Finished sending the request.
    4. pre_response: Beginning of header.
    5. response_data: Bytes of the header, download body, trailers.
    6. response: End of the response.

    For FTP:

    1. begin_control: Control connection opened.
    2. request_control_data: Commands sent to the server.
    3. response_control_data: Reply received from the server.
    4. pre_request/pre_response: Data connection opened.
    5. request_data/response_data: Bytes of the file upload/download.
    6. request/response: File uploaded/downloaded. Data connection closed.
    7. end_control: Control connection closed.
